# SFX Assets

Place CC0 sound files here for shoot, reload, and hit. The game will play them when available.

**Recommended (Kenney, CC0):**
- [Weapon Pack](https://kenney.nl/assets/weapon-pack) – use a short "shoot" and "reload" clip
- [Impact Sounds](https://kenney.nl/assets/impact-sounds) – use an impact clip for "hit"

**Required filenames (OGG or MP3):**
- `shoot.ogg` or `shoot.mp3` – played on fire
- `reload.ogg` or `reload.mp3` – played when reload starts
- `hit.ogg` or `hit.mp3` – played when bullet hits (wall/target)

If files are missing, the game runs without SFX (no errors).
